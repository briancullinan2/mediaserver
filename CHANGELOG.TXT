Implemented stream_select() in encode, this is the KEY! to making multiple streams work on a single threaded system
Made a correction to db_artists that was causing the search to completely fail!
Fixed some cleanup inefficiencies, now using NOT REGEXP in the expression
Thought about what to do for the similar_text() problem with the db_album and db_artist modules
Added Accept-Ranges handing to fs_file module, also abstracted some of the code just like db_file
Finished db_video and fs_video module, and made some corrections in the fs_modules
Finished implementing ranges into db_file module, multiple streams can now be started
Used session_write_close() when outputing files in order to allow browsing of other pages while files are downloading
Moved request validation to SQL class, this is so it can be overridden by other database types

2009-02-23
Put validation in the SQL class
Renamed all the $mysql variables to $database which is more appropriate
Fixed a bug with the dir $request variable being used, added preg_quote to quote the special character in the query

2009-02-20

Started on new mobile template

2009-02-19
Added a few more status features to the cron.php plugin
Fixed state for cron.php script using globals in the db_watch_list module
Changed the $database->get() and $database->set() functions to $database->query() and improved the API for accessing the database
Changed the cron script to use db_watch and db_watch_list modules for checking changed on the filesystem and adding files to the database
	This will potenially allow us to load any directory on the file while it is being browsed
Made improvements on sql queries which should allow easier parsing for different database types in the future
Started on db_albums and db_artists, abstraction level is perfect for code readability and minimizing repeated code

2009-02-18
Abstracted db_archive and db_diskimage module to using the db_file::get and db_file::cleanup functions
Fixed abstraction in all the modules, they can now specify modifiers and pass the $request to the file module
Fixed some problems with archive and diskimage modules, handles wasn't working on Windows because apprently <file>.zip\ also exists instead of exiting the for loop
Fixed counting in fs_archive and fs_diskimage, the matching and the !in_array was throwing off the count
Blogged about site
Migrated to new repository
Removed some unnessicary files from EXT JS template
Removed excess .htaccess files from all the subdirectories and put it in a location match

2009-02-17
Finished adding db_diskimage, time for some curl! for downloading movie information
Fixed db_archive and db_diskimage, there was a problem with showing the directory because it was acting like the fs_ version which is completely different
Archives not list out all directories properly even if the central directory doesn't specify one
Fixed db_archive module when adding zip files to database
Adding a nice percent complete print out in db_files module
Fixed cron.php plugin, it wasn't loading the state properly

2009-02-16
Worked on fs_imagedisk, outputting files works now
Worked on some more organization
Db_archive now fully functional, archives are searchable and in the database
Made the pretty dirs for the plugins the same for every plugins, links must now be specified in the template as /<plugin>/<category>/<id>/<filename>

2009-02-11
Added fs_ modules for handling reading files off the filesystem, this should make the use of a database a lot more modular
Fixed broken plugins from the fs_ modules change.
Fixed broken plugins by adding a little requirement to aliasing, in order to show bottom level directories an alias must match ^/$ alone
getIDsFromRequest() is only accessed by modules
Downloading files with database turned off works by using a hex encoded pathname to the file, it is automatically decoded by getIDsFromRequest() and each modules $request['selected'] handler
All plugins use the appropriate modules for getting file information
File.php plugin uses modules fully now
Cron.php plugin doesn't run if not using a database
Modules are now required to start with db_ for USE_DATABASE == true, and fs_ for USE_DATABASE == false
Common.php only loads modules that are needed for the type of USE_DATABASE

2009-02-09
Made select.php use the modules to get lists of files
Modified all the modules to handle the returning of their own file types, lots of repetitive code but leaves it more open for expansion
All modules can return a list of files off of the filesystem now, instead of using a database
Replaced includes with absolute path and ROOT_PATH, this enables the site to exist in a completely different location from the settings file and index page.
Tested setup on two different environments, installation is down to about 15 minutes and working perfectly.
Added functionality to db_file module for outputting file, it takes a mysql object, filename, and stream to output to.
Added links to default template for downloading files and browsing directories

2009-02-06
Finished Windows compatibility
Fixed many directory and file reference structure
Eliminated unnecissary settings
Added more $_request options to encode.php and convert.php plugins
Standardized settings so that ROOT_ always refers to a path on the filesystem and HTML_ always refers to something a template will use to access files

2009-01-31
Fixed some bugs in the cron.php script, folders leading up to the watch directories were being added and in turn causing them not to be scanned
Added an ignore directory option, folders in watch list can now be preceeded with ! sign in order to be ignored
Also added the same filtering to the cleanup scripts in each module
Fixed some problems in select.php, if folders exist on disk but are not in the database the script will not return an error
Added the usual item/on/off api for selecting files in list.php
Added a convert.php script for converting images
Added a kill9() function to common.php for killing processes after connection_abort() != 0
