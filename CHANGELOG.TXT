Worked on fs_imagedisk, outputting files works now
Worked on some more organization

2009-02-11
Added fs_ modules for handling reading files off the filesystem, this should make the use of a database a lot more modular
Fixed broken plugins from the fs_ modules change.
Fixed broken plugins by adding a little requirement to aliasing, in order to show bottom level directories an alias must match ^/$ alone
getIDsFromRequest() is only accessed by modules
Downloading files with database turned off works by using a hex encoded pathname to the file, it is automatically decoded by getIDsFromRequest() and each modules $request['selected'] handler
All plugins use the appropriate modules for getting file information
File.php plugin uses modules fully now
Cron.php plugin doesn't run if not using a database
Modules are now required to start with db_ for USE_DATABASE == true, and fs_ for USE_DATABASE == false
Common.php only loads modules that are needed for the type of USE_DATABASE

Made select.php use the modules to get lists of files
Modified all the modules to handle the returning of their own file types, lots of repetitive code but leaves it more open for expansion
All modules can return a list of files off of the filesystem now, instead of using a database
Replaced includes with absolute path and ROOT_PATH, this enables the site to exist in a completely different location from the settings file and index page.
Tested setup on two different environments, installation is down to about 15 minutes and working perfectly.
Added functionality to db_file module for outputting file, it takes a mysql object, filename, and stream to output to.
Added links to default template for downloading files and browsing directories

2009-02-06
Finished Windows compatibility
Fixed many directory and file reference structure
Eliminated unnecissary settings
Added more $_request options to encode.php and convert.php plugins
Standardized settings so that ROOT_ always refers to a path on the filesystem and HTML_ always refers to something a template will use to access files

Fixed some bugs in the cron.php script, folders leading up to the watch directories were being added and in turn causing them not to be scanned
Added an ignore directory option, folders in watch list can now be preceeded with ! sign in order to be ignored
Also added the same filtering to the cleanup scripts in each module
Fixed some problems in select.php, if folders exist on disk but are not in the database the script will not return an error
Added the usual item/on/off api for selecting files in list.php
Added a convert.php script for converting images
Added a kill9() function to common.php for killing processes after connection_abort() != 0
Added some links to the default select template for accessing the convert.php script
Modified the .htaccess for the plugins directory to redirect traffic for encoding and converting

2009-01-25
Started on re-encoding script, currently named encode.php under plugins
Updated EXT and Livegrid libraries successfully
Column information displays safely by downloading column titles

2009-01-05
Lots of improvments made
Finished Default template
Added template selector
Working on Ext JS template
Updated Ext library and livegrid library

2008-05-15
Added a type selector

2008-05-14
Add levels to templating system (a function that searches for levels and selects the closest one to preferred level)
Add a function for settings and array of values in the template
Added a function for settings request variables in template so form could recall the values it submits


2008-05-13
Add a button to clear search query
Make a page that holds the search form and the list selector
Move the button for creating a list (add it to builder)
Fixed image magick thumbnail creator in db_image.php module to only create 1 image on gifs and icons that contain multiple images


2008-05-12
Dividing up search form into a seperate processing page
List handles displaying a list of files processed from the search fields
Search query is kept in $_SESSION['search']
Everything displayed should be filterable by the search fields
Seperate selector and list output
