Fixed a bad error with db_archive and db_diskimage module, the Filepath was being passed to the db_ids modules with the addslashes before, so slashes were added twice
Fixed an error with db_ids module, if an ID wasn't in the array it overwrote the entire id array so it then rechecked every id
	Doesn't check for IDs in watch, watch_list, alias, and itself now
Worked on speed issues for cron.php script
Limit all select calls that include Filepath = "" by 1 because filepaths are unique

2009-04-07
Added the db_ids results to the file requests in plugins, this is so modules can try to be more efficient then just looking up filepaths
	Changed modules to use int ids, bigint is unnessicary and cost twice as much time, it is unlikely that anyone will load more then 2 billion files into the database
Changed db_ids to look up all the ids at once, it now accepts a $files parameter and appends all the needed id information
Fixed some problems with db_file module and the handle() functions

2009-04-05
Changed db_files search feature to put the directory matching first to narrow down results better
Worked on search page for live template

2009-04-04
Using the general search no longer affects other columns specified in the query
Worked on Live template, search page now looks nice

2009-04-03
Worked on live template, added information box, and Advanced Search button

2009-04-02
Created a LOCAL_BASE variable that is the base template for holding shared pages for other templates to use
Changed LOCAL_DEFAULT to the default template that loads when one is not selected
Modified db_archive module to use PEAR archive library, which works much better then the lib_id3
Worked on live template

2009-04-01
Fixed some speed issues when loading files, apparently checking the connection takes a while, so the watch_list now exists when it done scanning a directory instead of in between files
	Reduced the sleep, if they want efficiency and not as much load, you should use the small version on the system the files actually live on
	Fixed the archive and disk image module to set up the IDs to pass to db_ids, all IDs are 0 except for the respective module database
	Fixed db_watch_list modules handle_file() method to not "force" file modification if it is skipped

2009-03-31
Fixed db_amazon module to not access the database unnessicarily
Nearly finished live template
Fixed some problems in db_files and db_ids

2009-03-30
All modules return the ID of added or modified entry
	This makes adding items to the IDs database much faster when they are already known

2009-03-26
Added a few sleeps in the file looping, the directory looping, and the cron script watch_list looping
Added a struct() function to each module that returns the structure of the database
	Format is array('column_name' => 'type'), the type should be SQL compatible, and the php equivilent will try to be detected
	You can only search columns listed by the module::columns() function, ::struct() is used internally
	If a space is detected the type will be the first word and it will override NOT NULL being added to the create query
Added an INTERNAL constant to some classes to define if they should only be used internally
	this does not affect the functionality of any script, it is only used for template to filter out internal modules
	Added INTERNAL = true to db_watch, db_watch_list, db_alias, db_ids
All modules are now included and accessible, but only the appropriate db_ or fs_ modules are listed in $GLOBALS['modules']
	This is so functionality can be extracted from the db_modules and used in the fs_modules or vice versa
	But templates should still only use the modules that are not INTERNAL and are listed in $GLOBALS['modules']
Fixed plugins that check for cat, now they make sure the module being accessed isn't an INTERNAL module
Fixed db_watch_list module, and cron.php plugins, now it recognizes connection_abort() and doesn't exit immedialy, but instead when the current process is complete

2009-03-26
Made all the modules add() functions handle the ID for modifying in the same order as the handle() function
Fixed modules handling the removing of ids from database
Fixed some vulnerablities with not using htmlspecialchars() from global variables in templates

2009-03-25
New clause added to the top of plugins that require at least 1 file to be selected
	They now search the request when all possible fields that would return a result are empty
Added centralized ID database
Fixed modules not updating their files because db_file module always changes the date before other modules get to it
	Modules now return true if the file is added by the handle() method, 1 if the file modified, or false if the file is skipped
	There are a few exceptions, the db_watch_list module returns true by default and false if there are still files to scan
	
2009-03-24 (14,000+ lines of code)
Created a GLOBAL['database'] because it is not at all state dependant, and there is no reason to pass it to a bunch of different functions
Worked on db_amazon module
Created tokenizing function to take strings and parse out useless stuff

2009-03-23
Made cleanup faster by only checking for removed/non-existent files when the directory changes in the db_watch_list module
	Non-standard modules are still responsible for doing cleanup
Removed the cleanup_remove function since it is no longer needed
	Standard removing will remove files INSIDE of directories, to minize broken paths, this will remove files inside files like the db_archive and db_disk image by default as well

2009-03-20
Made a $GLOBALS['watched'] and $GLOBALS['ignored'] to minimize the amount of watch queries, this is not used everywhere

2009-03-12
Found out changing the Filepath and TEXT fields to BLOB didn't help the filepath checking of ascii names

2009-03-11
Changed db_file::cleanup() to use LEFT and LOCATE instead of REGEXP
Made masive progress on reports.php admin script
Fixed unicode problem by changing the TEXT columns in the database to BLOB, now binary text is preserved

2009-03-10
Fixed some searching and sorting problems in the db_files module
Fixed the fs_module::out() methods to work with new convention
Made db_playlist use standard db_file search functionality
Fixed some problems with accessing the ignored and watched files since db_file module regexp changes

2009-03-09
Made searched terms highlight on select page
Worked on db_file module and fixed some search functionality

2009-03-06
Fixed zip template, crc() can work with a file pointer, still working on bt.php plugin which uses md5
Improved searching capabilities in db_file

2009-03-04
Worked on db_playlist module, mostly working just needs some tweaks

2009-03-03
Added db_alias module to handle the aliases, although it is semi-incomplete
module::out() methods can only remove header declarations, they cannot set them, that is controlled by the plugin that calls it
Cron now doesn't clean or scan when a directory is unmounted or missing
Site now completely directory separator independant, it stores all files with / in between directories and all system calls replace the / with DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR

2009-03-02
Made cleanup more efficient by creating a THREASHOLD constant for how many times the cron should run before cleaning up
Also cleanup will fire when physical directories are changed and it is detected by the db_watch_list module, so they will no longer clean up when just adding new files to database
Found that vlc has even more transcoding errors when the bitrate is being downscaled, this may screw up the client player responsiveness
Fixed a problem with the db_watch_list module, if a directory in the db_watch list was searched but was never removed, it would recurse that directory infinitely
Set the site up so it can be run minimalistically across a network share
Fixed some issues with cron.php and common.php
Replaced most REGEXP queries with a series of LEFT and LOCATE modifiers to select files from paths, much faster!

2009-02-27
db_artists module now shows albums from an artist also has $all$ option that shows all the songs by that artist
Added log_error() function that prints out the cron messages but only to cron
Got files to be added when they are browsed, it is an imperfect system due to the way the default template works, folders need to be immediately browsable

2009-02-26
Moved Accept-Ranges back to the file.php plugin!  Modules should not be in control of output, only getting information from database
The Module->out() method now returns a SEEKABLE file resource, some can be custom like db_diskimage which can read a file out of a disk image and stop reading in the appropriate places
Added some filesize checking to the file.php plugin, it now checks everywhere that it can to try and get the Filesize value for using HTTP-RANGE, including the header (incase it was set by a module already)
Added extension from filename feature to encode, the desired output type can now be determined from the expension that is used on the filename field
Added a feature to making searches easier, the last filename in pretty dirs can now be a search term
Made encode.php plugin detect whether or not the %IF input field is used in the ENCODE_ARGS definition
Modified the modules to ignore errors from the pack() function, using encoding path IDs are easily corruptible
Made pretty dirs optional, they are still pretty and php parses off the directory part and puts it into the request
Fixed some stuff with the search, the search variable is not search instead of includes, and the includes variable is used for searching a literal string
Added a TRIM feature to order by queries that allows for sorting without preceeding words like A, AN and THE
Fixed db_artists and db_albums module, they now handle their own filepaths, and added more wrapper modules for Genre, and Year

2009-02-24
Implemented stream_select() in encode, this is the KEY! to making multiple streams work on a single threaded system
Made a correction to db_artists that was causing the search to completely fail!
Fixed some cleanup inefficiencies, now using NOT REGEXP in the expression
Thought about what to do for the similar_text() problem with the db_album and db_artist modules
Added Accept-Ranges handing to fs_file module, also abstracted some of the code just like db_file
Finished db_video and fs_video module, and made some corrections in the fs_modules
Finished implementing ranges into db_file module, multiple streams can now be started
Used session_write_close() when outputing files in order to allow browsing of other pages while files are downloading
Moved request validation to SQL class, this is so it can be overridden by other database types

2009-02-23
Put validation in the SQL class
Renamed all the $mysql variables to $database which is more appropriate
Fixed a bug with the dir $request variable being used, added preg_quote to quote the special character in the query

2009-02-20
Fixed watch_list module ignored specific directories now, runs an extra query to compare current directory with all the paths in the watch list
Started on new mobile template

2009-02-19
Added a few more status features to the cron.php plugin
Fixed state for cron.php script using globals in the db_watch_list module
Changed the $database->get() and $database->set() functions to $GLOBALS['database']->query() and improved the API for accessing the database
Changed the cron script to use db_watch and db_watch_list modules for checking changed on the filesystem and adding files to the database
	This will potenially allow us to load any directory on the file while it is being browsed
Made improvements on sql queries which should allow easier parsing for different database types in the future
Started on db_albums and db_artists, abstraction level is perfect for code readability and minimizing repeated code

2009-02-18
Abstracted db_archive and db_diskimage module to using the db_file::get and db_file::cleanup functions
Fixed abstraction in all the modules, they can now specify modifiers and pass the $request to the file module
Fixed some problems with archive and diskimage modules, handles wasn't working on Windows because apprently <file>.zip\ also exists instead of exiting the for loop
Fixed counting in fs_archive and fs_diskimage, the matching and the !in_array was throwing off the count
Blogged about site
Migrated to new repository
Removed some unnessicary files from EXT JS template
Removed excess .htaccess files from all the subdirectories and put it in a location match

2009-02-17
Finished adding db_diskimage, time for some curl! for downloading movie information
Fixed db_archive and db_diskimage, there was a problem with showing the directory because it was acting like the fs_ version which is completely different
Archives not list out all directories properly even if the central directory doesn't specify one
Fixed db_archive module when adding zip files to database
Adding a nice percent complete print out in db_files module
Fixed cron.php plugin, it wasn't loading the state properly
Fixed a lot of inconsistencies, now the $sql->get command only accepts an array of arguments
Worked on db_albums module and made very little progress

2009-02-16
Worked on fs_imagedisk, outputting files works now
Worked on some more organization
Db_archive now fully functional, archives are searchable and in the database
Made the pretty dirs for the plugins the same for every plugins, links must now be specified in the template as /<plugin>/<category>/<id>/<filename>

2009-02-11
Added fs_ modules for handling reading files off the filesystem, this should make the use of a database a lot more modular
Fixed broken plugins from the fs_ modules change.
Fixed broken plugins by adding a little requirement to aliasing, in order to show bottom level directories an alias must match ^/$ alone
getIDsFromRequest() is only accessed by modules
Downloading files with database turned off works by using a hex encoded pathname to the file, it is automatically decoded by getIDsFromRequest() and each modules $request['selected'] handler
All plugins use the appropriate modules for getting file information
File.php plugin uses modules fully now
Cron.php plugin doesn't run if not using a database
Modules are now required to start with db_ for USE_DATABASE == true, and fs_ for USE_DATABASE == false
Common.php only loads modules that are needed for the type of USE_DATABASE

2009-02-09
Made select.php use the modules to get lists of files
Modified all the modules to handle the returning of their own file types, lots of repetitive code but leaves it more open for expansion
All modules can return a list of files off of the filesystem now, instead of using a database
Replaced includes with absolute path and ROOT_PATH, this enables the site to exist in a completely different location from the settings file and index page.
Tested setup on two different environments, installation is down to about 15 minutes and working perfectly.
Added functionality to db_file module for outputting file, it takes a mysql object, filename, and stream to output to.
Added links to default template for downloading files and browsing directories

2009-02-06
Finished Windows compatibility
Fixed many directory and file reference structure
Eliminated unnecissary settings
Added more $_request options to encode.php and convert.php plugins
Standardized settings so that ROOT_ always refers to a path on the filesystem and HTML_ always refers to something a template will use to access files

2009-01-31
Fixed some bugs in the cron.php script, folders leading up to the watch directories were being added and in turn causing them not to be scanned
Added an ignore directory option, folders in watch list can now be preceeded with ! sign in order to be ignored
Also added the same filtering to the cleanup scripts in each module
Fixed some problems in select.php, if folders exist on disk but are not in the database the script will not return an error
Added the usual item/on/off api for selecting files in list.php
Added a convert.php script for converting images
Added a kill9() function to common.php for killing processes after connection_abort() != 0
Added some links to the default select template for accessing the convert.php script
Modified the .htaccess for the plugins directory to redirect traffic for encoding and converting

2009-01-25
Started on re-encoding script, currently named encode.php under plugins
Updated EXT and Livegrid libraries successfully
Column information displays safely by downloading column titles

2009-01-05
Lots of improvments made
Finished Default template
Added template selector
Working on Ext JS template
Updated Ext library and livegrid library

2008-05-15
Added a type selector

2008-05-14
Add levels to templating system (a function that searches for levels and selects the closest one to preferred level)
Add a function for settings and array of values in the template
Added a function for settings request variables in template so form could recall the values it submits

2008-05-13
Add a button to clear search query
Make a page that holds the search form and the list selector
Move the button for creating a list (add it to builder)
Fixed image magick thumbnail creator in db_image.php module to only create 1 image on gifs and icons that contain multiple images

2008-05-12
Dividing up search form into a seperate processing page
List handles displaying a list of files processed from the search fields
Search query is kept in $_SESSION['search']
Everything displayed should be filterable by the search fields
Seperate selector and list output
