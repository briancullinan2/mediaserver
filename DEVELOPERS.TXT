Templates:
If the template honors the ability to use mod_rewrite, every path has to add .php to the plugins path.

Modules:
Everything that uses a different file structure to display information should have a different module.  
For exmaple, the db_audio module accepts parameters for searching artists and albums, these modifiers change which results are displayed.
On the other hand, the db_album and db_artists displayes a completely different structure.
Modules are responsible for replacing Filepaths with the alias, module::get() and module::out() calls parse the input request with soft aliases, and output the soft alias
	module::handles() calls parse with both hard and soft aliases, and module::handle() calls parse just the hard aliases

Needs:
A svn module for connecting to remove or local SVN databases
Better support on windows for running commands
