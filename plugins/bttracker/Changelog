Changes between 1.5a and 1.5b
-----------------------------

- Sanity.php doesn't explode if peer caching is disabled.

- If countbytes is disabled (which it shouldn't be) there were problems.

- Bytes transferred field climbed much to fast (which also resulted in the
  speed being too high (not that it was ever accurate to begin with))

Changes between 1.5 and 1.5a
----------------------------

- Sanity.php was not updated for the new summary table write caching code.

- getPeerInfo logic flaw

- Helped optimized the peer deleter for the case of mass deletion.


Changes between 1.4 and 1.5
---------------------------

- Speed optimizations all around, including database structure.
  Backwards compatibility preserved.

- newtorrents.php reads username and password from config.php.
  Will complain if settings are not changed from defaults or are missing.

- BEncode library is class wrapped to preserve namespace. Global
  functions still present, so no script changes should be necessary.

- Does not ban Shareaza (but if you want to, it's easy - see top of
  tracker.php)

- /scrape includes number of downloads to date.

- Check for transparent proxies using X-Forwarded-For HTTP header

- Optionally disable speed and bytes transferred stats. This help improves
  performance under heavily loaded trackers, but very slightly.

- Support for bclib

- Peer caching support

- All web scripts re-themed with CSS (by msdossys)
