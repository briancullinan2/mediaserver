------------- GENERAL TODO -------------
Look at drupal and find out if there is a better way to save errors to the session at the end of a script
Add module called balancer used for load balancing
	Basically it allows the administrator to set different conditions for when to use a different subdomain for accessing media
		It will forward the use to the other domain with the exact same request information based on the conditions
	This will allow multiple computers running identical set ups to output files and transcode more efficiently
	Enter username and password for each remote services and download the remote load balancing information to check for conflicts and easy reference
Add 'guess' parameter to list module to allow randomly selected files from the same genre
Add 'long_play' option to encode so instead of inputting a file to vlc, the system inputs a playlist and devices only have to buffer once and no more breaks
Add a register script to the install process that allows users to register a username, password, and domain for their site, with the monolithicmedia drupal site.
	Include a key that is unique to every download, to prevent spamming.
Abstract the setup functions, modules should be set up after being loaded to load more dependencies, this is similar to drupal's module.install file
Fix up template settings in core.php core_variables() function
Current solution for dependencies is not very good, rewrite, possibly call module init whenever handles() is called?
	Checks abstracted into setting_ wrappers, is this the best solution?
Finish setting input handling in the modules admin plugin
Create a status admin tool
Finish setting() function in settings.php plugin
	Settings should also be loadable from the database
Cache all loaded module files in settings database (possibly storing in admin settings and deserializing would be efficient?)
	Save module settings in database
Make validate_return actually validate the return path
Test and find a fix for some media dropping off the network
	Check to see if the file exists in the archive handler before trying to analyze it
Remove all occurances on props['WHERE'] being set to a string
	It should be set to an array from now on, so that we can differentiate between each query_alter_
	Same with all the other variables
Start implementing lang() calls
	If the page has language variables that are not known
		Call the index page with lang_only which runs through the entire identical request and gets all the lang calls
		Generate a query to the google api to translate using multiple q variables
		Similar to how errors are handled()?
		Save the translations
	Fix where to save translations
	Fix up lang calls, accept multiple parameters and don't translate certain fields,
		this will allow us to insert things like file paths in the middle of the sentence
Set variables to default specified by template if they are not set because of an improper input
Finish ampache.php module to support genres, videos, and playlists
Check for bt module in install.php script
Add bttracker install script to admin/install.php to fully bootstrap the install process
Speed testing with new User queries
More compatibility testing with clients
Store the remote_address in the session, and if it doesn't match up with what is in the session then kill the session and die
Create a unique id and insert it into forms, this is required when the form is submitted
Make hard links and soft links, hard links are replaced when they are put in to the database, soft links are replaced when they are read from the database, this will allow us to do more network stuff
Interface with mediatomb and support UPnP protocol
------------- ADMIN TOOLS -------------
Port all Jamu stuff from MythTV to PHP admin tools
Finish fixing up modules to use new API
	admin tools section
Work on tools.php module for admin
	Provide useful information in tools section about missing songs (music.php tool?)

------------- Module TODO -------------
Finish users.php module
Work on settings.php module
	Global settings such as default template to use for each device logged in the to account
	Template settings, must provide specification in template config, use database for storing fields?
Make a sync module in admin section for syncing between two databases and pulling out differences
	Use musicbrainz to sync music
FIX bt.php module to work with command line torrent seeder on windows
Set up conditions for when the streams are used based on if %OF and %IF are used in the command arguments
Get ranges working in encode module
	only allow the option if the argument can read from stdin and read the input from the handler and write it to the input stream
Figure out a way of doing this with files even if stdin is not being used in the command, if fopen is writing to a file, does it file feof when reading from the same file simulaneously?
Make convert.php module recognize video thumbnails and use vlc to extract them
------------- Handler TODO -------------
Make a discography handler that parses out wikipedia discographys, store album information, and return links to Full Discography, and Partial Discography
	Base discography handler on discogs.com
	this will list out each artist with full or missing albums
	It handles artists, when an album count changes or doesn't exist it updates the database
Work on playlist handler, use hard links to help find files
Make a fs_code handler
Work on db_movies, use cUrl to download movie information from imdb, use the volume decriptor for lookup, this shouldn't change even if they edited an image
	Look up movies on amazon, and see if that will help with searching IMDb
	Research the video_ts.ifo file, there must be a way of getting the full name from a DVD image, windows media center projects can do it, so can we
