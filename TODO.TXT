Fix HTML_ROOT usage to use generate_href instead (this is hard)
Finish fixing up plugins to use new API
Drupalish style coding
	Plugins must register themselves just like the tools
	Register directory structure so that only the top level plugin can be accessed for security
	Register a name and description so they can be disabled in the admin panel
	More streamlined way of plugins outputting data to template (assuming that $files is being used is no good)
Request variables must also register themselves
	The core requests will be defined in a core.php plugin
	Must register a validate function or the variable is discarded completely
	Plugins register request variables not modules
Modules should be the only access to the database, no more custom code like ampache plugin
	Using a callback might make it faster
	Should be more streamlined to provide quicker access like ampache plugin
Create a developer plugin that verifies plugins register themselves and don't use query() function
Doxygen compliant
Speed testing with new User queries
More compatibility testing with clients
Test compatibility with PEAR_MIME modifications to common.php
------------- GENERAL TODO -------------
Convert all log_error to PEAR_ERROR and add to debugging template
Store the remote_address in the session, and if it doesn't match up with what is in the session then kill the session and die
Create a unique id and insert it into forms, this is required when the form is submitted
Make hard links and soft links, hard links are replaced when they are put in to the database, soft links are replaced when they are read from the database, this will allow us to do more network stuff
Interface with mediatomb and support UPnP protocol
------------- Plugin TODO -------------
Finish users.php plugin
Add user permissions to ampache.php plugin
If they try to access a script other then cron in the tiny remote version, forward them to the HTML_SITE defined in the settings

Make a sync plugin in admin section for syncing between two databases and pulling out differences
	Use musicbrainz to sync music
Fix bt.php plugin, using the stream methods won't work with md5
	maybe it should only handle files on disk because the ctorrent seeder won't be able to read files out of a zip anyways
	FIX bt.php plugin to work with command line torrent seeder on windows
Set up conditions for when the streams are used based on if %OF and %IF are used in the command arguments
Get ranges working in encode plugin
	only allow the option if the argument can read from stdin and read the input from the module and write it to the input stream
Figure out a way of doing this with files even if stdin is not being used in the command, if fopen is writing to a file, does it file feof when reading from the same file simulaneously?
Make convert.php plugin recognize video thumbnails and use vlc to extract them
------------- Module TODO -------------
Look in to the possibility of corruption if the db_files::handles check for is_dir or is_file is removed (if file is removed before cron.php detects it, it won't load all the available information from DB)
Make a discography module that parses out wikipedia discographys, store album information, and return links to Full Discography, and Partial Discography
	Base discography module on discogs.com
	this will list out each artist with full or missing albums
	It handles artists, when an album count changes or doesn't exist it updates the database
Work on playlist module, use hard links to help find files
Make a fs_code module
Work on db_movies, use cUrl to download movie information from imdb, use the volume decriptor for lookup, this shouldn't change even if they edited an image
	Look up movies on amazon, and see if that will help with searching IMDb
	Research the video_ts.ifo file, there must be a way of getting the full name from a DVD image, windows media center projects can do it, so can we
