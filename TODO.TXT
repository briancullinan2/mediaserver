------------- MONOLITHICMEDIA TODO -------------
------------- GENERAL TODO -------------
IMPORTANT: Finish the configuaration for updates.php and implement new method of reporting changes like described above
	See configure_balancer for more information
Running system from command line should change bootstrap options
Cron is not running properly again...
Finish webdav module that allows files to be uploaded and access using the web dav protocol.  This is already mostly supported by PEAR.
Look at drupal and find out if there is a better way to save errors to the session at the end of a script
	Fix session problems with storing errors
	Consider printing and clearing all possible errors up until the error print out, then save the rest
Add module called balancer used for load balancing
	Maybe this modules could help with hard and soft links?
	Make sure remote balancer is enabled and dependencies are met, add a status print out to the output function of balancer
	The depends on for balancer should take in to account the session setup
		Redirection based on percentage will not be possible if it cannot count the sessions\
		If a database is set up load that first and use that for session comparing
Install script is severely broken
Add a register script to the install process that allows users to register a username, password, and domain for their site, with the monolithicmedia drupal site.
	Include a key that is unique to every download, to prevent spamming.
Store the remote_address in the session, and if it doesn't match up with what is in the session then kill the session and die
Create a unique id and insert it into forms, this is required when the form is submitted
Make hard links and soft links, hard links are replaced when they are put in to the database, soft links are replaced when they are read from the database, this will allow us to do more network stuff
------------- MEDIA MODULES -------------
Test playing using http://flowplayer.org/demos/index.html and hopefully be more successfull than JW Player (Mike)
Search module could be configured to use a different algorithm for searching, possibly an external site 
	like Google could display results or one of those cool database searching services that cost money
Add 'guess' parameter to list module to allow randomly selected files from the same genre
Add 'long_play' option to encode so instead of inputting a file to vlc, the system inputs a playlist and devices only have to buffer once and no more breaks
Finish ampache.php module to support genres, videos, and playlists
More compatibility testing with clients
Interface with mediatomb and support UPnP protocol
Test and find a fix for some media dropping off the network
	Check to see if the file exists in the archive handler before trying to analyze it
Set up conditions for when the streams are used based on if %OF and %IF are used in the command arguments
	Verify these settings in the status for encode and convert
Add support for encode and convert to be configured based on individual file extensions
Get ranges working in encode module
	only allow the option if the argument can read from stdin and read the input from the handler and write it to the input stream
Figure out a way of doing this with files even if stdin is not being used in the command, if fopen is writing to a file, does it file feof when reading from the same file simulaneously?
Make convert.php module recognize video thumbnails and use vlc to extract them
------------- LANGUAGE MODULE -------------
Start implementing lang() calls
	If the page has language variables that are not known
		Call the index page with lang_only which runs through the entire identical request and gets all the lang calls
		Generate a query to the google api to translate using multiple q variables
		Similar to how errors are handled()?
		Save the translations
	Fix where to save translations
	Fix up lang calls, accept multiple parameters and don't translate certain fields,
		this will allow us to insert things like file paths in the middle of the sentence
	the default Google AJAX functionality can be used for translations that are not found
		Or the default output for text that doesn't have a translation could be the English text with an AJAX query attached
			to call the server again for the translations after the page is fully loaded
	Consider translating the pages with special keys surrounding the text and using the default google translate and somehow
		submitting the translations back to the server for caching
		Or pulling out the translations for later use
------------- BITTORRENT MODULE -------------
FIX bt.php module to work with command line torrent seeder on Windows
bt module should have a configurable ctorrent settings that uses %IF for the torrent file to start seeding server side
	Should also check dependencies for bttracker and ctorrent
Check for bt module in install.php script
Add bttracker install script to admin/install.php to fully bootstrap the install process
------------- ADMIN TOOLS -------------
Make a movie services tool that allows you to check vudu and netflix and block buster for movies
Make a tv services tool that allows you to use myepisodes and hulu
Allow ranking of all available services
How about a nifty little remote RPC admin tool or a debug tool
Port all Jamu stuff from MythTV to PHP admin tools
Work on music tool
Add show renamer to admin tools
Make a sync module in admin section for syncing between two databases and pulling out differences
	Use musicbrainz to sync music
------------- Module TODO -------------
Finish users.php module
Work on settings.php module
	Global settings such as default template to use for each device logged in the to account
	Template settings, must provide specification in template config, use database for storing fields?
------------- Handler TODO -------------
Make a discography handler that parses out wikipedia discographys, store album information, and return links to Full Discography, and Partial Discography
	Base discography handler on discogs.com
	this will list out each artist with full or missing albums
	It handles artists, when an album count changes or doesn't exist it updates the database
Work on playlist handler, use hard links to help find files
Work on db_movies, use cUrl to download movie information from tmdb, use the volume decriptor for lookup, this shouldn't change even if they edited an image
	Look up movies on amazon, and see if that will help with searching IMDb
	Research the video_ts.ifo file, there must be a way of getting the full name from a DVD image, windows media center projects can do it, so can we
------------- All Template TODO -------------
Templates should have functions for outputting their own files instead of using the file output stream in the output_template() function, make this obsolete
Never include path in template reference, the validate_ function always removes the path
Set variables to default specified by template if they are not set because of an improper input
Figure out how template_path and modules_path is used in the javascript in the WMP and EXT JS templates
Test modifications to extjs and wmp template script and link includes
Finish mobile template.
Finish Ampache XML API template
Implement a GrooveShark clone template
Work on finishing EXT JS template, and add more templates from Ampache, Jinzora, Subsonic, and WinAmp Remote
------------- DEFAULT -------------

	Space evenly which does the spacing and
	Use tables, which puts results in a table, and 
	Use Javascript which selects item with javascript instead of forms
	FIX detail options in default template

Fix initial load time in FolderView.js
Work on category view/show in groups in FolderView.js, add items that take up whole line and have headers
Fix tooltip popup in FolderView.js, in wrong panel maybe?
Press letter on the keyboard to go to that folder in FolderView.js and select.php
Change desktop style to be buttons like folders in Desktop.js but render buttons to index.html
Get settings dialog working and set up user accounts to control it
Finish the player app that displays pictures
Make players resize to Player window
------------- LIVE -------------
Fix javascript select and right click in all browsers
Fix appearance in IE and Chrome
	Chrome, the module list doesn't wrap, whitespace:nowrap?
