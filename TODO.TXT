Get streams working in convert.php plugin and set up conditions for when the streams are used based on if %OF and %IF are used in the command arguments

2009-02-25
Now that streams are working, create a system for using both the module->out() methods and an intermediate program
	this will enable streaming out of a diskimage for example
Set the content length to $bitrate * $song_length, this will give us a fairly accurent content-length
Make sure the watched directory is mounted, if it is still in the database but doesn't exist on disk, prompt for input in the admin section and don't remove non existing files on cleanup
Do memory checks and don't run cron if it's above a certain threshhold, maybe run some stuff with niceness

Get ranges working in encode plugin, then move the input to the appropriate module out() function
	only allow the option if the argument can read from stdin and read the input from the module and write it to the input stream
Figure out a way of doing this with files even if stdin is not being used in the command, if fopen is writing to a file, does it file feof when reading from the same file simulaneously?
Finish db_video module, should be easy with all the abstraction
Make convert module recognize video thumbnails and use vlc to extract them

Fix Accept-Ranges section in the db_file module out() method
Interface with mediatomb and support UPnP protocol

Add support for creating thumbnails in convert.php script
FIX bt.php plugin to work with command line torrent seeder on windows
------------- Module TODO -------------
Make cleanup faster by having the other modules check if their paths are still in the files database instead?  it is still a lot of queries but would it be faster then checking the file system?
	maybe instead of string compares, the IDs can be used, this would take some refactoring of each module
Find a solution for adding files that are being browsed immediately, do a check in handles maybe for db_ modules that adds it to the database immediately if it is trying to be accessed?
Work on db_movies, use cUrl to download movie information from imdb, use the volume decriptor for lookup, this shouldn't change even if they edited an image
	Research the video_ts.ifo file, there must be a way of getting the full name from a DVD image, windows media center projects can do it, so can we

Improve abstraction in the modules, so much repeated code!
Figure out what to do for albums, either a modifier to the $request and pass it to db_files module, or keep the get statement overriden
Make cleanup more efficient, only clean up files for changed folders
Make the settings.php plugin load individual settings for each template, settings should be submitted by the template, and used by the template, templates handle their own validation of settings

Work getIDsFromRequest() into the modules only, and make the modules able to return items based on a list of IDs
Figure out how to download files out of a zip file
Download files without USE_DATABASE set to true, allow the actual filename to be used?  with USE_DATASE check to make sure it is in the database?
FIX detail options in default template
Work out a system for passing files to their module first, in select.php when a directory is used it should use the module to determine if it exists
This will enable doing things like passing in a zip using the fs_zip category and getting files back from it
The file.php should also use the modules, passing in a stream STDOUT should be written to by the module, this will enable us to use the modules for writing out zipped files
Any raw file access should refer to the module, this should enable us to turn off database support, and run completely on the modules returnin the right information
What optimizations can be put in cron that the modules should support? How about returning false for ->handles? When you pass a file in that is inside the ignored paths
Add a no database options first, this will help us figure out how to allow some modules to always run without a database
