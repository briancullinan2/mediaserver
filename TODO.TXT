Work out a system for passing files to their module first, in select.php when a directory is used it should use the module to determine if it exists
This will enable doing things like passing in a zip using the fs_zip category and getting files back from it
The file.php should also use the modules, passing in a stream STDOUT should be written to by the module, this will enable us to use the modules for writing out zipped files
Any raw file access should refer to the module, this should enable us to turn off database support, and run completely on the modules returnin the right information
What optimizations can be put in cron that the modules should support? How about returning false for ->handles? When you pass a file in that is inside the ignored paths
